# donatelli.tech admin (a fork of Swiish)

This repository is the **donatelli edition** of [Swiish](https://github.com/MrCrin/swiish) 0.7.0:
the admin back office for [donatelli.tech](https://donatelli.tech). It is where the owner logs
in, edits the contact card and site facts, publishes the website through GitHub Actions, and
reads the details visitors send from the card. It is not the official Swiish and is not
endorsed by its author.

What differs from upstream:

- The public card lives on donatelli.tech as a static page. This server turns off every Swiish
  public card surface (cards, QR, manifests, icons, uploads, invitations) and marks every
  response `noindex`.
- Production refuses to start on unsafe settings, sessions can be revoked, and `/setup` needs a
  one-time `SETUP_TOKEN`.
- The fork builds its own Docker image, commits `package-lock.json`, and has tests and CI.

Start here:

- [docs/donatelli-deploy.md](docs/donatelli-deploy.md): hosting assumptions, environment,
  backups and recovery.
- [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md): the AGPL-3.0 modification notice and trademark position.
- [COPYING](COPYING): the full AGPL-3.0 text. Source: <https://github.com/Njdonatelli/donatelli.swiish>.
- [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) and the sections below describe upstream Swiish (its images, demo and
  card features) and are kept unchanged for reference.

Run the tests (Bash/Zsh, Node 22, in the repository directory):

```bash
npm ci && npm test
```

Success: `npm ci` prints `added … packages`, and the test summary ends with `# fail 0`.

The end-to-end run drives every screen in a real browser. It needs a `donatelli-website` checkout beside this
repository (or `E2E_WEBSITE_DIR`) and Playwright's Chromium:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium && CI=true npm run build && npm run test:e2e
```

Success: the last line reads `e2e: N screens and checks, no problems`.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **For Docker deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **For local development**: Node.js 20.9+ and npm

### Installation

#### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)

See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for complete Docker setup instructions.

#### Option 2: Manual Installation (For Development)

1. Clone and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrCrin/swiish.git
   cd swiish
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env
   ```

3. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm start  # React dev server on http://localhost:3000
   ```

For production, build and serve:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run serve  # Runs on PORT from .env, default 3000
   ```

## Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values.

### Required Variables

- **`JWT_SECRET`** - Secret key for JWT token signing. Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`

### Optional Variables

- **`NODE_ENV`** - Environment mode (`development` or `production`)
- **`PORT`** - Server port (default: `3000`)
- **`APP_URL`** - Base URL for the application (required in production)
- **`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`** - Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins
- **`MAX_FILE_SIZE`** - Maximum file upload size in bytes (default: 5MB)
- **`FORCE_HTTPS`** - Force HTTPS redirects (`true` or `false`)
- **Email Configuration (SMTP)** - For email features like invitations

See `.env.example` for all available options and their descriptions.

### Demo Mode (Experimental)

Demo mode allows visitors to explore Swiish without requiring authentication or setup. This is useful for showcasing the platform on dedicated demo instances.

#### Enabling Demo Mode

1. Set the `DEMO_MODE` environment variable to `true`
2. Restart the server
3. The app will automatically:
   - Seed the database with demo company "Demon Straight" (a fictional company that makes really straight things)
   - Create 6 demo employees with different card configurations
   - Skip the login flow and auto-authenticate visitors
   - Reset all data every hour to maintain a clean demo state

## Usage

### Creating Your First Card

1. Complete the initial setup wizard at `/setup` to create your organization and admin account
2. Log in to access the admin dashboard at `/admin`
3. Click "Create New Card"
4. Enter a unique slug (e.g., `john-doe`)
5. Fill in your contact information, add custom links (with optional uploaded icons), upload images, customize the theme
6. Click "Save"
7. Your card is now available at `http://your-domain.com/john-doe`

### Sharing Cards

- **Direct Link**: Share the card URL directly
- **QR Code**: Click the share button on any card to generate a QR code
  - **Simple Mode**: QR code contains just the card URL
  - **Full Details Mode**: QR code contains vCard data for direct contact saving

### Privacy Controls

Each card supports three privacy options:

- **Require Interaction**: Users must click "See my details" before contact info is revealed
- **Client-Side Obfuscation**: Contact information is obfuscated in the HTML
- **Block Robots**: Prevents search engines from indexing the card

### Send Your Details Controls

Each card's public page can show a "Send your details" CTA that lets visitors open
WhatsApp, email, or a drop-call to reach the card owner. From the card editor's
**Sharing** tab you can:

- Turn the whole CTA on/off with a master switch
- Independently enable/disable the WhatsApp, Email, and Drop call channels

This is useful, for example, if you don't have a WhatsApp-capable number and want to
disable just that channel while still allowing email or call. Organisation owners can
lock these options for members via **Admin Settings → Send Your Details**.

### Theme Customization

Swiish features a powerful theming engine with design tokens for colors, textures, border radius, and border width. Built-in themes include "swiish" and "minimal". You can create custom themes by adding files to `src/theme/`.

For detailed theming instructions, see the [full documentation](https://github.com/MrCrin/swiish/wiki/Theming).
